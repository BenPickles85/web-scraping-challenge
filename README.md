<h1>Mission To Mars</h1> 
<h3>Web Scraping Challenge</h3>

This project scrapes information relating to Mars from multiple websites and collates this onto a singular webpage. 

The coding for the scraping of the data from the various websites was initially created as an ipynb file and then exported to .py under the title scrape_mars.py. 

The app.py python program utilises the scrape_mars.py and the index.html scripts to first load the landing page. 
When the "scrape new data" button is activated", the page will load a recent news title and paragraph text, an image of mars, a table of mars facts and high resolution imahes of each of Mars' hemispheres.
